# Landing Page

## Introduction

This is a repo for the [Landing Page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) Project for the Foundations Course on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). 

This project requires the creation of a web page from scratch based on a design provided by The Odin Project.

The design is based on two images: first, an image of the complete website, and second some details about some of the fonts and colours used.

## Desired outcome

### Hints and Tips

- The font being used in the images is Roboto.
- Hero text is the statement that appears at the top of a web page.
- The website has four main sections (and a footer)
- Some small details may not have been encountered before. This is by design. These details are minor, and are easily searched (e.g. ```css rounded corners```).
